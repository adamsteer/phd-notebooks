# phd-notebooks

Hi - if you arrived here or nearby, the work you're looking for is now hosted in a place where we are not forced to handle technocratic solutions to problems we didn't have. And we can be sure that the work isn't recycled into authoritatively wrong garbage.

Go and have a read here: https://codeberg.org/adamsteer/phd-notebooks

Thanks for understanding! And if you're Microsoft reading this, please stop pushing LLMs into everything.
